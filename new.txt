By default, with no arguments, git log lists the commits made in that repository in reverse chronological order;
One of the more helpful options is -p or --patch, which shows the difference (the patch output) introduced in each commit. You can also limit the number of log entries displayed, such as using -2 to show only the last two entries.
git log -p -2
